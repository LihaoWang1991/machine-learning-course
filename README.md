# machine-learning-course
This repository contains the programming assignments I have completed in Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). 

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: 
* Week 1: Introduction (no programming assignment)
* Week 2: [Linear Regression with Multiple Variables](https://github.com/LihaoWang1991/machine-learning-course/tree/master/machine-learning-ex1)
* Week 3: [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/LihaoWang1991/machine-learning-course/tree/master/machine-learning-ex2)
* Week 4: [Neural Networks: Representation](https://github.com/LihaoWang1991/machine-learning-course/tree/master/machine-learning-ex3)
* Week 5: [Neural Networks: Learning](https://github.com/LihaoWang1991/machine-learning-course/tree/master/machine-learning-ex4)
* Week 6: [Advice for Applying Machine Learning](https://github.com/LihaoWang1991/machine-learning-course/tree/master/machine-learning-ex5)
* Week 7: [Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/LihaoWang1991/machine-learning-course/tree/master/machine-learning-ex6)
